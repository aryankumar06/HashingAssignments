Question 2:
Problem: Find the Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Constraints:

1) Your algorithm should run in O(n) time.

Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4], so the length is 4.
